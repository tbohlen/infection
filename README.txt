# An Amateur's Model of Infection

Inspired by COVID-19.

Please use and modify as you see fit. Attribution would be appreciated!

A few notes about the system
- Most importantly, I have NO expertise in epidemiology. Please don't think of
this as an accurate model of an epidemic, but instead a fun animation that can
help prompt questions and conversations. Please look into peer-reviewed literature
before drawing any conclusions.
- I don't know how good the network models are. By network model, I mean the way
which simulated people have contact with which other simulated people. Do they
match the reality of our society? A bit more work on structuring and randomizing
the networks would likely be better
- It would be great to control the age distribution to match different populations.
